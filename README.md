# FileMate

FileMate is your all-in-one, offline-first command-line tool for file manipulation and organization. Born out of the need for a robust, privacy-respecting alternative to online file utilities.

FileMate aims to be the Swiss Army knife for handling files of all types‚Äîimages, PDFs, documents, and more‚Äîdirectly from your terminal.

## Why FileMate?

Most file manipulation tools are either fragmented, online-only, or limited in scope.
FileMate was created to unify essential file operations under a single, extensible CLI, ensuring your data never leaves your machine.

Whether you're batch-renaming images, changing file extensions, or preparing for more advanced operations, FileMate is designed to be your trusted companion for all things file-related.
